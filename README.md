# JavaScript Search Algorithms

![JavaScript Search Algorithms](/assets/repo-banner.jpg "MarineGEO logo")

In this repository, you will find the most popular search algorithms like linear search, binary search, etc. implemented in JavaScript. This project helps you to learn about algorithms and specifically **search algorithms.**

## Few Things

Every search algorithm has its detailed description in the source file of the algorithm in comments. The source file contains information about how algorithms is implemented step-by-step.

As you know we have implemented the search algorithms in JavaScript so that every developer can learn and prepare for the coding interview.

### üõà Implementation

All the search algorithms are implemnetd in JavaScript although you can implement these search algorithms in any language you feel comfortable with as Python, C++, or Java.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note!

**This project is intended to be used for learning purposes only.**

## üì¶ About the Project

This project is helpful for developers who wish to improve their **problem-solving skills** and learning the basics of algorithm writing.

Solving problems is crucial skill for developer to learn; well our brain has built-in problem solving components but we have to use them to tell the computer what to do and how to do using our programming skills.

### ü§ñ What is an algorithm?

Well before getting to the technical definition, I would like to give you an example.

Suppose you are given a list of numbers and your job is to find the largest number in the list. How would you do this?

Ask this question to your brain üß† how did it find the largest number. Well It is simple. Your brain compared each number and thus found the biggest number.

How do you teach the computer üñ•Ô∏è to do the same job?

_Algorithm is a set of well-defined and distinct instructions to solve a problem._
